I'm Pluto, also known as Miyamii and/or Tomoko online. I work with both computer hardware and software!

Aside from being a professional procrastinator, I'm also the creator of these cool little things:

- Zora
- Stolaris
- Lynx
- Kairos

I'm also the founder of Meisei, a little silly group that just works on silly little projects!
Alongside all of this, I was the person behind `x3`, `ZK-95`, and `Z-NT` programs!

My main programming languages are C, C++, and Python! (I don't do Lua anymore, neither do I do Java.)

If you're interested, you can also commission (essentially hire me) for your projects! I have provided my carrd for commissions alongside my itch.io store page:
